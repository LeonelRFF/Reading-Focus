To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/LeonelRFF/Reading-Focus.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd Reading-Focus

    ```
4.  **Compile the Sass files:**

    npm run build:sass
    ```
    *For continuous development, you can use `npm run watch:sass`. This will automatically recompile your styles whenever you save a change to a `.scss` file.*

5.  **Load the extension in your browser (Chromium-based):**
    *   Open Chrome/Edge and navigate to `chrome://extensions` or `edge://extensions`.
    *   Enable **"Developer mode"** (usually a toggle in the top-right corner).

## üí° Usage

Once installed, you can use the extension in two main ways:

1.  **From the Context Menu:**
    *   Select any text on a webpage.
    *   Right-click the selection.
    *   Choose the **"Read with Reading Focus"** option. This will open a new tab with your selected text ready to be read.

2.  **From the Extension Icon:**
    *   Click the Reading Focus icon in your browser's toolbar.
    *   The behavior depends on your settings in the **Extension Options** page:
        *   If **"Automatically extract article content"** is **checked**, the extension will parse the current page, extract the main article, and open it in the reader tab.
        *   If it is **unchecked**, a blank reader tab will open, ready for you to paste text or import a file.
